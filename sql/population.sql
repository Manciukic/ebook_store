(48,'Jude the Obscure','Thomas Hardy','Jude the Obscure was first published in its complete form in 1895\, just after finishing its serial run in Harper’s Magazine.

Although the legends were already hundreds of years old by the fifteenth century\, the contemporary stories of Arthur in Malory’s day were primarily French.

The case is mired in the legal quagmire of the Court of Chancery\, whose byzantine and sluggish workings Dickens spares no effort to expose and condemn. Dickens also exposes the miserable condition of the poor\, living in squalid\, pestilential circumstances.',11.6,'ebooks/charles-dickens_bleak-house.epub'),

In some sense mankind had just begun to believe he had the universe figured out when the universe struck back with a tragedy so terrible in scale it could not be fit into any box of understanding.

Childers carefully interweaves fiction with real-world places\, events\, and politics\, making for an extremely convincing story of invasion—so convincing that some (perhaps erroneously) credit the novel with spurring the creation of new English naval bases.

(432,'Dubliners','James Joyce','Dubliners is a collection of picturesque short stories that paint a portrait of life in middle-class Dublin in the early 20th century.
